# Hello World
My name is Claire, and I am a third year Information Technology student at GSU. I am originally from Savannah, but enjoy the uniqueness of  Statesboro. In my spare time, my favorite things to do would be: watching netflix, hanging out with friends, or tinkering around with a computer.
