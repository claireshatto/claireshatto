	<p>I went to a prestigious All Girls Catholic High School, Named St. Vincent's Academy. It is located in the beautiful Historic Downtown Savannah. I liked going to school there because it was different than the other High schools in Savannah.</p>
	<p>Currently I am a Junior at Georgia Southern University. My Major is Information Technology, with a Spanish Minor. I decided to major in IT because I have always been fasinacated with technology and how it works. I like to troubleshoot problems, and tend to think outside the box.</p>
